"""Regression tests for the ParallelSlot self-count deadlock.

Runs ask-20260601T2010* (and the 200833 batch) all failed ~1s after
`slot_acquired` with "Chrome CDP unresponsive but other workers hold
ParallelSlots; refusing to kill shared Chrome." The shared Chrome's CDP had
genuinely wedged, but recovery could never fire: `ensure_shared_chrome_running`
runs *inside* the worker's own ParallelSlot, and the old `_slots_held()` counted
that own slot as a held one — so every worker (even a lone serial run) saw a slot
held and refused to kill+relaunch. These tests pin the fix: a slot-holding caller
passes `skip_slot_id` so only *other* workers block the kill.
